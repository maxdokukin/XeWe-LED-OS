- void SystemController::led_strip_reset() add define from the main sketch
- add validation constaints on the user inputs for numbers and strlen();
    - add this check //    if (num_led_new > NUM_LEDS_MAX)
    - add wifi max len for ssid and pass to match up with the memory
- add wifi AP mode selector so i can debug esp without iphone hotspot since it enforces AP isolation
