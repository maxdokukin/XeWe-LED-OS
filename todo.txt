-[x] maybe brightness should hold the state as well? return 1 as min brightness if the state is off. i see lots of capabilities to encapsulate shit there
-[x] brightness should have last_non_zer0_brightness, and mana it completely. include turn on and turn off fucntions
-[x] add $led reset
-[x] add $help
-[x] remove verbose
-[x] add system init cmd
-[x] change wifi function names in systemcontroller
-[x] push release 0.1
-[x] add led strip pin and led num update through the terminal
-[x] add led pin and led len set up to the system reset


- void SystemController::led_strip_reset() add define from the main sketch
- add validation constaints on the user inputs for numbers and strlen();
    - add this check //    if (num_led_new > NUM_LEDS_MAX)
    - add wifi max len for ssid and pass to match up with the memory
- add wifi AP mode selector so i can debug esp without iphone hotspot since it enforces AP isolation
- add on the fly handling for brightness set if the brightness is already changing brighntess setnew(current, new)
- add on the fluy change to the color change if the color is already changing new colorchaaging(current rgb, target rgb)
- add 3 wifi conection attempts
- add optimization to timers to avoid calculate progress execution too often
- move led strips arrays in the system class

- add wifi static ip storage after the system init. if router dosent let use static ip, throw blinking yellow signal
- ditch eeprom and spiffs to nvs ot file storage

- add async serial port for the system led to always work

- color sync with alexa does not work! brightness and state sync work well.
