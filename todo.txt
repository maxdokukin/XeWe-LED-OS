- fill in draft functions
- add $enable $disable flows

- test setup flow modularity
- test $enable $disable flows

- add validation constaints on the user inputs for numbers and strlen();
    - add wifi max len for ssid and pass to match up with the memory
- add 3 wifi re-conection attempts

- add wifi static ip storage after the system init. if router dosent let use static ip, throw blinking yellow signal

- add async serial port for the system led to always work?

- add button to cmd binding. cmd parser validate_cmd(); if so, then use this use that button to trigger the change

- add doc (haha)
- add perlin noise
- remane memory to nvs

- clean up the * & references and logic
- check init setup edge cases
- pass smart home device name from input

- does homekit really need wifi credentials, or can i set them up just as it is rn
