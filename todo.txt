-[x] maybe brightness should hold the state as well? return 1 as min brightness if the state is off. i see lots of capabilities to encapsulate shit there
-[x] brightness should have last_non_zer0_brightness, and mana it completely. include turn on and turn off fucntions
-[x] add $led reset
-[x] add $help
-[x] remove verbose
-[x] add system init cmd
-[x] change wifi function names in systemcontroller
-[x] push release 0.1
-[x] add led strip pin and led num update through the terminal
-[x] add led pin and led len set up to the system reset
-[x] add on the fly handling for brightness set if the brightness is already changing brighntess setnew(current, new)
-[x] add on the fluy change to the color change if the color is already changing new colorchaaging(current rgb, target rgb)
-[x] ditch eeprom and spiffs to nvs ot file storage
-[x] color sync with alexa and homekit do not not work! brightness and state sync work well. (might be lib limitation)


- add validation constaints on the user inputs for numbers and strlen();
    - add this check
    - add wifi max len for ssid and pass to match up with the memory
- add 3 wifi re-conection attempts
- move led strips arrays in the system class

- add wifi static ip storage after the system init. if router dosent let use static ip, throw blinking yellow signal

- add async serial port for the system led to always work

- add smart home device name input on reset

- add button to cmd binding. cmd parser validate_cmd(); if so, then use this use that button to trigger the change

- reorganize init flow to avoid code duplication during the normal boot
- add modules flow variables (wifi, alexa, homekit)

- add doc (haha)
- add perlin noise

- change update flag[0] to be the one that writes in the memory here:
void                            SystemController::led_strip_set_length            (uint16_t new_length, std::array<bool, 3> update_flags) {
    DBG_PRINTF(SystemController, "led_strip_set_length(new_length=%u, update_flags=[%d,%d,%d])\n", new_length, update_flags[0], update_flags[1], update_flags[2]);
    led_strip.set_length(new_length);
    memory.write_uint16("led_len", new_length);
    memory.commit();

    if (update_flags[0])
        web_interface.broadcast_led_state("length");
    if (update_flags[1])
        alexa.sync_state_with_system_controller("length");
    if (update_flags[2])
        homekit.sync_state();
}

plan:
- polish init
- add device name support
- add modularity control (wifi, alexa, homekit)
- clean up tech debt
- rewrite boot up logic after init to reuse the code
